# Normalization Effect
 Study the effect of normalization in V1 neurons
 
 In this exercise, we simulated V1 neurons in a uniform-grid set up.
 We also implemented a Macro-micro grid set up, which is also the Neuron grid in the codes.
 
 Then, we produced the animated simulation w.r.t. to a point stimulus at the center of the uniform-grid.
 
 To get a new simulation: run Model_Main.py
 
 Model_Main.py requires InitializationTimeMd.py to initialize;
 
 InitializationTimeMd.py reuires NeuronGrid.py and ModelUtil.py to provide instruction for computations.
 
 Other necessary files:

 NrnResponse.py returns the response of a neuron w.r.t. a point stimulus
 
 TuningCurves.py provides the receptive field for a neuron to generate a response
 
 NSclasses.py provides the basic data structure to pack neuron and stimulus objects
