# NormalizationEffect
This repo studies the effect of divisive normalization in V1 (primary visual cortex) by simulating a sheet of V1 neuron population's time-iterated response distribution towards point stumuli.

Central formula for divisive normalization: 
$$ R = \gamma \cdot \frac{I^n}{\sigma^n + I^n + I_m^n} $$
